Understanding fritzing files:

"...A Fritzing "sketch" is a diagram with three views: breadboard, schematic, and pcb. In each view there are a number of parts, some of which are connected by wires or traces. There may be multiple instances of a given part. Most parts are visible in all three views, but some are not. Parts have a specific location, and wires have a pair of endpoint locations. A given individual part instance, or wire, may have an individual set of properties (such as color or resistance). All this information is stored in the sketch file.

Fritzing saves files sketch files with an .fzz extension. This is simply a renamed .zip file. Inside the fzz/zip you will find a sketch (.fz) file. This file is in an XML format, and this format is subject of this document. The .fz file is required inside the fzz/zip; the fzz/zip may optionally contain custom part files (.fzp and .svg), and code files (such .ino or .bas).
